## the app just runs and shows you some information on the classes when the objects are created.
I tried making some sort of school flow chart system that has departments which have subclasses of being math departments or something that has courses defined in it. also staff and students. Most of it is just there for the assignment's sake. but when you run it it displays some information on the university.
